### MG-MAMPOSSt, a code to test gravity with the mass profiles of galaxy clusters

MG-MAMPOSSt is a FORTRAN code that extended the MAMPOSSt algorithm of G. Mamon, A. Biviano and G. Bou√©, 
that performs Bayesian fits of models of mass and velocity anisotropy profiles to the distribution of tracers in projected phase space, 
to handle modified gravity models and constrain its parameters. The new version implements two distinct types of gravity modifications, 
namely general chameleon (including $f(\mathcal{R})$ models) and beyond Horndeski gravity (Vainshtein screening).

### Install

To install and run MG-MAMPOSSt execute the following scripts in this order:
```bash
./script/script_Lib.sh -f <compiler_name> -d <directory_path> 
./script/script_compile.sh -f <compiler_name> 
./script/script_runmam.sh  
```
type -h for help 
Default compiler is "f95", default directory is "$PWD". If you want to set your own path, be sure to put a backslash at the end of the path, e.g.:
```bash
./script/script_Lib.sh -f <compiler_name> -d /home/pizzuti/test/
```

### Input parameters
Input parameters are stored in the file Input_pars/pars_all_N_O_spec_DS.
Additional options are in Options.txt.
All the required information about the structure of these files can be found in the pdf user manual 

### Output
Output files can be found in the Output folder. Main is MaxLik_test.dat, 
which stores the tabulated $-\ln\matchal{L}$, where $matchal{L}$ is the 
likelihood/posterior, as a function of the model parameters.
