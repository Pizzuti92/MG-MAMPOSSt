# MG-MAMPOSSt, a code to test gravity with the mass profiles of galaxy clusters 

[(Main page)](https://github.com/Pizzuti92/MG-MAMPOSSt)

## Introduction

MG-MAMPOSSt is a FORTRAN code that extended the MAMPOSSt algorithm of G. Mamon, A. Biviano and G. Bou√© - 
which performs Bayesian fits of models of mass and velocity anisotropy profiles to the distribution of tracers in projected phase space -
to handle modified gravity models and constrain their parameter space. The new version implements two distinct types of gravity modifications, 
namely general chameleon (including $f(\mathcal{R})$ models) and beyond Horndeski gravity (Vainshtein screening). MG-MAMPOSSt efficently explores the parameter space either by computing the likelihood over a multi-dimensional grid of points or by performing a simple Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. 
The code requires a Fortran90 compiler or higher and makes use of the Python3 [getdist package](https://github.com/cmbant/getdist) of Antony Lewis to plot the marginalized distributions in the MCMC mode.

### Documentation

A full description of the code functionalities, input parameters and output files is given in the pdf user manual available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07194).

## Install

To install and run MG-MAMPOSSt on a Linux terminal, download the .zip file which contains all the dependencies. Note that the main source code gomamposstoptS.f requires additional routines which are stored in the various folders shipped within the code. Some routines are taken from free FORTRAN libraries available on the web. Credits to the developers are given in the header of the source files of these routines.

### Install with CMake

The configuration and installation requires at least CMake 3.17.1. 
Execute the following commands:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
$ sudo cmake --install .
$ cd ..
```
To run and test the code, execute:
```bash
$ gomamposst < gomamposst_x.inp
```
which produces the main outputs, or
```bash
$ ./script/script_runmam.sh  
```
which also generates additional plots if the MCMC mode is selected (see below).
Note that to run the above script, permissions should be changed to make it executable. Otherwise, one can simply use the ``` sh ``` environment.

## Overview of usage

Here we summarize all the necessary information to perform a complete run of the code.

### Dataset

The directory data/ stores the datafiles of projected phase spaces (p.p.s) that serve as input to the MG-MAMPOSSt procedure. The files are structured as a table where the number of rows coincides with the number of data points. The first column is the projected radius in units of $\text{kpc}$, the second and thirds columns represent the l.o.s. velocities and the associated errors in units of $\text{km/s}$. Note that data points should be given in the rest frame of the cluster.
The first two lines are considered as comment lines when \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt} read the data.

### Input parameters
Input parameters are stored in the file Input_pars/pars_all_N_O_spec_DS. 
Additional options are in Options.txt where one can customized the mode 
All the required information about the structure of these files can be found in the [pdf user manual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07194)


### Output
Output files can be found in the Output folder. Main is MaxLik_test.dat, 
which stores the tabulated $-\ln\mathcal{L}$, where $mathcal{L}$ is the 
likelihood/posterior, as a function of the model parameters.
