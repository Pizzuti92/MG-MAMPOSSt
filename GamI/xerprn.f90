!***DESCRIPTION
!
! This routine sends one or more lines to each of the (up to five)
! logical units to which error messages are to be sent.  This routine
! is called several times by XERMSG, sometimes with a single line to
! print and sometimes with a (potentially very long) message that may
! wrap around into multiple lines.
!
! PREFIX  Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This argument contains
!         characters to be put at the beginning of each line before
!         the body of the message.  No more than 16 characters of
!         PREFIX will be used.
!
! NPREF   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This argument is the number
!         of characters to use from PREFIX.  If it is negative, the
!         intrinsic function LEN is used to determine its length.  If
!         it is zero, PREFIX is not used.  If it exceeds 16 or if
!         LEN(PREFIX) exceeds 16, only the first 16 characters will be
!         used.  If NPREF is positive and the length of PREFIX is less
!         than NPREF, a copy of PREFIX extended with blanks to length
!         NPREF will be used.
!
! MESSG   Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This is the text of a
!         message to be printed.  If it is a long message, it will be
!         broken into pieces for printing on multiple lines.  Each line
!         will start with the appropriate prefix and be followed by a
!         piece of the message.  NWRAP is the number of characters per
!         piece; that is, after each NWRAP characters, we break and
!         start a new line.  In addition the characters '$$' embedded
!         in MESSG are a sentinel for a new line.  The counting of
!         characters up to NWRAP starts over for each new line.  The
!         value of NWRAP typically used by XERMSG is 72 since many
!         older error messages in the SLATEC Library are laid out to
!         rely on wrap-around every 72 characters.
!
! NWRAP   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This gives the maximum size
!         piece into which to break MESSG for printing on multiple
!         lines.  An embedded '$$' ends a line, and the count restarts
!         at the following character.  If a line break does not occur
!         on a blank (it would split a word) that word is moved to the
!         next line.  Values of NWRAP less than 16 will be treated as
!         16.  Values of NWRAP greater than 132 will be treated as 132.
!         The actual line length will be NPREF + NWRAP after NPREF has
!         been adjusted to fall between 0 and 16 and NWRAP has been
!         adjusted to fall between 16 and 132.

!***ROUTINES CALLED  I1MACH, XGETUA
!***REVISION HISTORY  (YYMMDD)
!   880621  DATE WRITTEN
!   880708  REVISED AFTER THE SLATEC CML SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING OF
!           JUNE 29 AND 30 TO CHANGE THE NAME TO XERPRN AND TO REWORK
!           THE HANDLING OF THE NEW LINE SENTINEL TO BEHAVE LIKE THE
!           SLASH CHARACTER IN FORMAT STATEMENTS.
!   890706  REVISED WITH THE HELP OF FRED FRITSCH AND REG CLEMENS TO
!           STREAMLINE THE CODING AND FIX A BUG THAT CAUSED EXTRA BLANK
!           LINES TO BE PRINTED.
!   890721  REVISED TO ADD A NEW FEATURE.  A NEGATIVE VALUE OF NPREF
!           CAUSES LEN(PREFIX) TO BE USED AS THE LENGTH.
!   891013  REVISED TO CORRECT ERROR IN CALCULATING PREFIX LENGTH.
!   891214  Prologue converted to Version 4.0 format.  (WRB)
!   900510  Added code to break messages between words.  (RWC)
!   920501  Reformatted the REFERENCES section.  (WRB)

!       SET NEXTC TO THE POSITION IN MESSG WHERE THE NEXT SUBSTRING
!       STARTS.  FROM THIS POSITION WE SCAN FOR THE NEW LINE SENTINEL.
!       WHEN NEXTC EXCEEDS LENMSG, THERE IS NO MORE TO PRINT.
!       WE LOOP BACK TO LABEL 50 UNTIL ALL PIECES HAVE BEEN PRINTED.
!
!       WE LOOK FOR THE NEXT OCCURRENCE OF THE NEW LINE SENTINEL.  THE

!       OF THE SECOND ARGUMENT.
!
!       THERE ARE SEVERAL CASES WHICH SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR IN THE

!                       PRINT NOTHING TO AVOID PRODUCING UNNECESSARY
!                       BLANK LINES.  THIS TAKES CARE OF THE SITUATION
!                       WHERE THE LIBRARY ROUTINE HAS A MESSAGE OF
!                       EXACTLY 72 CHARACTERS FOLLOWED BY A NEW LINE
!                       SENTINEL FOLLOWED BY MORE CHARACTERS.  NEXTC
